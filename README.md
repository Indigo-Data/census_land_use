# Description of the Project

The analysis contained in these files was based on coursework done during my degree for a module on data analysis and data management.  

For the coursework we were given two datasets in Excel. The first was the 2021 census data the usual resident population by sex and five-year age group of local authorities (LAs) in England and Wales.

The second dataset was land use data from 2018 for England. 

To produce the coursework we were asked to develop and answer one question related to the 2021 census data alone and then to devise a second question which we could answer only through combining the 2021 census data and the 2018 land use data. We had to use Python to store and analyse the data. 

As part of the data analysis we had to include: 

- at least two data visualizations
- a choropleth map
- use of a data mining technique
- a final 3000 word report on our data sources, analysis pipeline, findings and conclusions.

I chose to answer the following questions:

1. How much do the age profiles of different regions of England and Wales differ?
2. Are there a higher proportion of under 35-year-olds in more urban areas of England compared with more rural areas?

The accompanying files show the data analysis I performed, my conclusions and the report I wrote.

The accompanying files include:

1. Population Pyramids – A Jupyter Notebook and pdf of the Notebook showing the cleaning of the 2021 census data and wrangling it into a form suitable for generating population pyramids.
2. Distribution of Age Ranges – A Jupyter Notebook and pdf of the Notebook calculating the  distribution of the proportion of people in different age ranges across the Local Authorities.
3. Cleaning land use data, aligning and merging census data and land use data – A Jupyter Notebook and pdf of the Notebook amending the Local Authorities where they did not match between the two datasets and merging the datasets.
4. Analysing data using k-means clustering, chi-squared test and choropleth maps – A Jupyter Notebook and pdf of the Notebook containing much of the analysis for question 2. 
5. Folium Maps – A copy of the Folium maps as they would not convert successfully to pdf via LaTeX.
6. Report of Age Demographics and Land Use – a pdf of the final 3000 word report I produced detailing my analysis, the findings and conclusions.
